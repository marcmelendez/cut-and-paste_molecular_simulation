# Cut-and-Paste Molecular Simulation
Cut-and-paste molecular simulation codes, small enough to fit on a business
card. Ideal for teaching, benchmarks and testing.

* **bd.c**: Diffusion of Brownian particles.
* **lb.c**: Two-dimensional lattice-Boltzmann simulation of the flow around a circular obstacle.
* **mc.c**: Hard-sphere Monte Carlo simulation with periodic boundary conditions.
* **md.c**: Molecular dynamics of Lennard-Jones interactions with periodic boundary conditions.
